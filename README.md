The repository for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) specialisation in C++ from Goldsmiths, University of London, via Coursera

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) specialization in C++ from Goldsmiths, University of London, via Coursera. This repository showcases projects completed as part of the specialization, focusing on practical applications of C++ and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Courses Completed
- [Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-i?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
- [C++ Programming: Classes and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-ii?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
- [Object-Oriented Programming in C++: Functions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-iii?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
- [Working with Objects in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-iv?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
- [Use C++ to Build a Crypto Trading Platform: Final System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-v?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
  
## Final Project
I developed a simplified cryptocurrency trading platform as the final project during this specialisation.
This project demonstrates proficiency in various programming techniques, including:

- Basic control flow and input/output
- File parsing
- User interaction on the console
- 
## Repository Contents
- Implementations and documentation of the final project.

## Acknowledgments
I'm truly grateful to Dr. Matthew Yee-King, Goldsmiths, University of London, and Coursera for providing a precious learning experience in C++ and OOP.
